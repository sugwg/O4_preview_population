Data Release for "Mining the Alerts: A Preliminary Catalog of Compact Binaries from the Fourth Observing Run

Event files
 * O1O3_events.txt : Events from the 4-ogc catalog
 * class_events.txt: Lower mass events that use class-based chirp mass estimates
 * sky_events.txt: Remaining events which use skymap based estimates
 * sky_events_poor_fit.. : Events that don't fit the nonspinning fiducial model, results for both the nonspin limit and effective spin 0.5 are provided.
